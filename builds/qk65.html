        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Meet the QK65, the first keyboard from QwertyKeys. The QK65’s body has been designed from the ground up<br>
            to provide great value without sacrificing aesthetic or acoustic quality, featuring a CNC-machined aluminum<br>
            top case with anodized or electrophoretic finish, a PVD-coated stamped steel plate, a die-cast aluminum<br>
            bottom case, and a large molded silicone dampener that comfortably fills the space between.<br>
            Each QK65 kit comes with a solderable or hot-swappable ANSI PCB, as well as a plate made of your choice<br>
            of aluminum, FR-4, polycarbonate, or POM. All PCB and plate variations have unique flex cuts, and<br> 
            includes two styles of gasket mounts alongside three pieces of case foam, allowing the QK65 to provide<br> 
            a wide range of user-defined typing experiences.</p>

        <h3>Mounting Style: Gasket Mount</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>A gasket mount uses gasket material between the plate and keyboard housing on both top and bottom sides.<br>
                This gives the board a slightly more cushioned feel since the plate isn’t in direct contact with the <br>
                other metal components of the keyboard.</li>
        </ul>
