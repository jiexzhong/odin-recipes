        <h3>Mounting Style: Top & O-Ring</h3>
       
        <p>For this keyboard, there's not one but two mounting variations. The Gummy O-ring mount is a mounting style<br>
            that uses an O-ring as a gasket that sits between the plate and PCB. It utilizes specific PCB cutouts to<br>
            keep the plate in place. The O-ring gaskets help soften and reduce plate vibration allowing the keyboard<br>
            to have a lower pitch and soft feel. The Gummy O-ring mount is currently not as popular as other mounting<br>
            styles. However, with how successful keyboards such as the Singa Unikorn and Bakeneko60/65 are, enthusiasts<br>
            are now paying more attention to this mounting style. In this article, we will be taking a closer look at<br>
            he Gummy O-ring mod to find out what itâ€™s all about.</p>
